<!-- # Scope Homework: Who Dunnit

### Learning Objectives

- Understand function scope
- Know the difference in between the let and const keywords

## Brief

Using your knowledge about scope and variable declarations in JavaScript, look at the following code snippets and predict what the output or error will be and why. Copy the following episodes into a JavaScript file and add comments under each one detailing the reason for your predicted output.

### MVP -->

<!-- #### Episode 1

```js
const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Miss Scarlet',
  room: 'Library',
  weapon: 'Rope'
};

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${scenario.murderer}.`;
}

const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```
This will print 'The murderer is Miss Scarlet'. -->

<!-- #### Episode 2

```js
const murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
}

const declareMurderer = function() { -->
  <!-- return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```

This is going to be an error as murderer is a constant so cannot be changed. -->

<!-- #### Episode 3

```js
let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const declareMurderer = function() {
  let murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

const firstVerdict = declareMurderer();
console.log('First Verdict: ', firstVerdict);

const secondVerdict = `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
console.log('Second Verdict: ', secondVerdict);
```

The first verdict is going to print out 'The murderer is Mrs Peacock' as the declareMurderer is given a new value for the murderer, and the second verdict is going to print out 'Professor Plum' because it is accessing the initial murderer variable. -->

<!-- #### Episode 4

```js
let suspectOne = 'Miss Scarlet';
let suspectTwo = 'Professor Plum';
let suspectThree = 'Mrs. Peacock';

const declareAllSuspects = function() {
  let suspectThree = 'Colonel Mustard';
  return `The suspects are ${suspectOne}, ${suspectTwo}, ${suspectThree}.`;
}

const suspects = declareAllSuspects();
console.log(suspects);
console.log(`Suspect three is ${suspectThree}.`);
```

First 'The suspects are Miss Scarlet, Professor Plum, Colonel Mustard' will be printed then 'Suspect three is Mrs Peacock' will be printed. It is because there is a local variable in declareAllSuspects so then Colonel Mustard is displayed and the two initial ones.  -->

<!-- #### Episode 5

```js
const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Miss Scarlet',
  room: 'Kitchen',
  weapon: 'Candle Stick'
};

const changeWeapon = function(newWeapon) {
  scenario.weapon = newWeapon;
}

const declareWeapon = function() {
  return `The weapon is the ${scenario.weapon}.`;
}

changeWeapon('Revolver');
const verdict = declareWeapon();
console.log(verdict);
```

'The weapon is the Revolver' will be printed because the property of the scenario object can be mutated/changed. -->

<!-- #### Episode 6

```js
let murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mr. Green';

  const plotTwist = function() {
    murderer = 'Mrs. White';
  }

  plotTwist();
}

const declareMurderer = function () {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```

This prints 'The murderer is Mrs White'. Because within the constant changeMUrderer the murderer is changed to Mr Green then another function plotTwist assigns murderer to Mrs White which is called and then changeMurderer is called. -->

<!-- #### Episode 7

```js
let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mr. Green';

  const plotTwist = function() {
    let murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';

    const unexpectedOutcome = function() {
      murderer = 'Miss Scarlet';
    }

    unexpectedOutcome();
  }

  plotTwist();
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```
The murderer is Mr Green. The plotTwist function has a local variable murderer which does not change the one in changeMurderer and so the unexpectedOUtcome changes only the murderer of the plotTwist. -->

<!-- #### Episode 8

```js
const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Mrs. Peacock',
  room: 'Conservatory',
  weapon: 'Lead Pipe'
};

const changeScenario = function() {
  scenario.murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
  scenario.room = 'Dining Room';

  const plotTwist = function(room) {
    if (scenario.room === room) {
      scenario.murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';
    }

    const unexpectedOutcome = function(murderer) {
      if (scenario.murderer === murderer) {
        scenario.weapon = 'Candle Stick';
      }
    }

    unexpectedOutcome('Colonel Mustard');
  }

  plotTwist('Dining Room');
}

const declareWeapon = function() {
  return `The weapon is ${scenario.weapon}.`
}

changeScenario();
const verdict = declareWeapon();
console.log(verdict);
```

The weapon is Candle Stick. First we change the murderer and room and as the parameters for the functions plotTwist and unexpectedOUtcome are true the weapon property is changed. -->

<!-- #### Episode 9

```js
let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

if (murderer === 'Professor Plum') {
  let murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```
The murderer is Professor Plum. Even though the murderer is changed it is done so with a local variable which does not affect the first one. -->
